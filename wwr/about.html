            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Amazing Expeditions began as a small passion project in 2012, founded by a group of adventure enthusiasts
                who believed
                that the best memories are made on the water. What started with a single raft and weekend trips has
                grown into a trusted
                and respected rafting company serving adventurers from around the world.
                Driven by a commitment to safety, environmental respect, and genuine outdoor excitement, we steadily
                expanded our fleet,
                built carefully designed routes, and trained a team of skilled, certified guides. Over the years,
                Amazing Expeditions
                has become known not only for thrilling rides, but also for creating meaningful connections between
                people and the
                natural world.
                Today, we continue to honor our roots—providing unforgettable journeys, one rapid at a time.</p>
