        <p>Hello! My name is Prosper Tengey, and I am currently studying Software Development at Brigham Young
            University-Idaho
            (BYU-Idaho). I chose this path because I have always been fascinated by how technology works and how simple
            lines of code
            can solve complex problems. Software development gives me the opportunity to think creatively, build
            meaningful
            projects, and constantly challenge myself to learn new skills.
            I believe this field is essential to the future. As society becomes more digital, software developers play a
            key role in
            creating tools that improve communication, strengthen businesses, enhance education, and make everyday tasks
            easier. By
            developing reliable and innovative software, I hope to contribute to solutions that support communities,
            create
            opportunities, and help people live more connected and productive lives.
